Modify the `TodoList` component so that, instead of rendering the `items` array within the `ul` tag, it calls the function passed to its `render` prop, passing it the `items` array as a parameter, as well as the function required to delete the item. Pass a render prop to the `TodoList` component to correctly render and interact with the `items` array.
